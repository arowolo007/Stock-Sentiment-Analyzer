A sentiment analyzer on the assets with my stock portfolio, using financial news headlines and vader sentiments.

This is a sentiment analyzer for the various assests in my portfolio,
It gets the news headlines from finviz.com a website that shares information
on everything related to the financial markets.
I will be using beautiful soup library to scrap the news section from various
assest in my portfolio and stacking them up in a dataframe.
and finally use vader_sentiment from the popular NLP library NLTK to determine
the positivity or negativity.
Finaly, i will be ploting it on a graph to have a visual understanding of the 
result
